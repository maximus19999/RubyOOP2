i managed to get all funtionality of the requirements working i do believe.
i chose to make an extra GDP class that is a super class of the Country so all Country classes would have access to the GDP hash map
for there score calculations

i added a varible of score value to the country class to make the sorting easier, and simpler.
my medalRanings class handles all of the computations pretty much for display purposes and also includes the function to load in the 
data from the medal.txt file.
i tried to keep all localised funtions to each class seperate and simple to avoid any cross over between the classes, trying to avoid lag
