i have a hierachy of 
Hand
EvaluateHands
TwoCardHands/FiveCardHands
then all the indiviual card games on the same level. (spider, liar, light and Idiot).

i put it in this order because of the order of needed functions. All Game hand classes need the Evaluate function but only needed the
allocation of number of cards differing only two sorts. though the evaluate function did need to be slightly different for Spider.
Hand was obiiously up the top because it was requireded to pass the greatest amount of functions to the lower classes.
the only things i put in the Liar, light etc classes was the initailsation definition , as each Hand had different values for their alloted cards.
